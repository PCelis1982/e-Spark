      <p className="mb-4">
        At <strong>e-Spark</strong>, we are driven by conviction — conviction that <strong>Europe’s electrification is not just necessary, it’s inevitable</strong>. The shift toward sustainable mobility is urgent, and we are building the infrastructure to accelerate it.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We are <strong>pro-climate, pro-technology, and pro-action</strong>. Our mission is to power the transition to <strong>clean, intelligent transportation</strong> by deploying a network of advanced EV chargers, integrated with <strong>energy storage systems</strong> and optimized for both end-user experience and grid operability.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        But we go beyond hardware. We’re creating a <strong>tokenized infrastructure layer</strong> — one that bridges <strong>real-world energy assets</strong> with the <strong>digital economy</strong>. Through blockchain technology, we track and manage assets, automate operations, and open infrastructure investment to a global market.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We understand where financial markets are heading: toward <strong>decentralized asset ownership</strong>, <strong>Web3-enabled finance</strong>, and <strong>impact-aligned returns</strong>. e-Spark is built for this — with <strong>performance-linked tokens</strong> governed by smart contracts that mirror real economic output.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We're not just deploying EV chargers — <strong>we’re delivering a blueprint for sustainable, decentralized, and intelligent infrastructure investment</strong>. Our platform brings together energy, blockchain, and finance in one scalable model.
      </p>

      <p className="font-bold text-cyan-300">
        Join us at the frontier where <strong>mobility, energy, and the new economy converge</strong>.
